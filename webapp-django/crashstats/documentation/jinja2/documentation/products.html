    <h1 id="policy">Products on Crash Stats</h1>
    <p>
        The Socorro crash ingestion pipeline handles incoming crash reports for
        Mozilla products. Crash reports are collected, processed, and
        available for search and analysis using the Crash Stats web site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Incoming crash reports have a <code>ProductName</code> key which
        specifies which product the crash report is for. For example, incoming
        crash reports for Firefox desktop have <code>Firefox</code> as the
        key. The crash reporter sets this using the value of
        <code>MOZ_APP_BASENAME</code> in <code>browser/confvars.sh</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crash reports for products that Socorro doesn't recognize are
        discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Socorro collects build information for products. Currently, build
        information is scraped from
        <a href="https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/">archive.mozilla.org</a>. In
        the future, we plan to switch to using
        <a href="https://mozilla-services.github.io/buildhub/">BuildHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Build information is required to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>fix version numbers in processing</li>
        <li>drive the product home page in the Crash Stats site</li>
        <li>support forms in the Top Crashers page in the Crash Stats site</li>
        <li>support forms in the Exploitability page in the Crash Stats
            site</li>
        <li>suggest products in the "Product" field in the Super Search page in
            the Crash Stats site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If your product doesn't have build information on archive.mozilla.org,
        then parts of the site won't work for your product.
    </p>
    <p>
        Socorro collects active version information from
        <a href="https://product-details.mozilla.org">product-details.mozilla.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Current active version information is required to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>drive the product home page in the Crash Stats site</li>
        <li>support forms in the Top Crashers page in the Crash Stats site</li>
        <li>support forms in the Exploitability page in the Crash Stats site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If your product doesn't have active version information on
        product-details.mozilla.org, then parts of the site won't work for your
        product.
    </p>
